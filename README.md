# Overview

## What is it?

TouchPanel is an open-source platform-independent alternative to TouchPortal.

## Why another alternative?

There are several reasons I created this:
1. TouchPortal is very limited without the pro version, but I don't want to spend money on it.
2. There are alternatives, but they either don't fit my needs or aren't compatible with linux (I use arch btw).

## Disclaimer

To code the buttons, you need to know how to code in python.
