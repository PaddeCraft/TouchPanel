# Scripting the buttons

## Info

To add functionality to the buttons, you need to use python. The scripts should be located in ~/.PaddeCraftSoftware/TouchPanel/scripts.

## Libs

While you could code everything from scratch, TouchPanel provides a few build-in libraries. More about them [here](./libs/).
