# Scripting the buttons

## Info

To add functionality to the buttons, you need to use python. The scripts should be located in ~/.PaddeCraftSoftware/TouchPanel/scripts.

## Libs

While you could code everything from scratch, TouchPanel provides a few built-in libraries. More about them [here](./libs/).

## Built-in functions and variables

These variables are built-in:
- btnid: the button that ran the script

These functions are built-in:
- loadPage(pageCuid) *

* You can get the page cuid by going to the page settings and copying it from the 'page' url parameter.
